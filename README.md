# Razzle TODO_APP

Testing razzle (https://razzlejs.org) - with a todo app

-   Has a small rest api - using the inbuild express server
-   Include connection to mongo db - add your connection string to the .env.local file as indicated in the .env.local.example

### Opinion so far about razzlejs 
<br>

I honestly really like the framework. Bringing the best features of [Nextjs](https://nexjs.org) and [Create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/). 

I especially like the use of [React-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) in a server side rendered application.

more thoughts to come as i keep exploring razzlejs ...


Enjoy the small example of the use of CRA and SSR

#### HAPPY CODING!!
